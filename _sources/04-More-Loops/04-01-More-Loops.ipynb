    "In [Chapter 3](../03-Collections-Loops/03-01-Collections.md) \n",
    "we considered loops through collections, especially \n",
    "lists.  Most of our loops took the form of doing something with each \n",
    "item, one by one, such as counting or summing the items.  We also \n",
    "looked at creating a summary (such as a count) for each value found \n",
    "in a collection (e.g., a count of the number of students in each \n",
