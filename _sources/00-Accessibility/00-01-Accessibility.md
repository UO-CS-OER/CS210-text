# Accessibility Statement

We are committed to making this text and accompanying materials free,
open, and accessible to everyone, including students with 
disabilities. If you encounter accessibility issues with this text 
or the accompanying materials, including projects, please [contact 
us](mailto:michal@uoregon.edu?subject=Textbook accessibility issues).

## Accessibility features

### Screen-reader compatibility 

We are attempting to make the web version of this text accessible to 
those who use 
screen-reader technology. 
-  The content can be navigated using a keyboard
- links, headings, and tables are formatted to work with screen readers
- images have alternative text
- information is not conveyed by color alone

This is work in progress, and we appreciate your notes regarding 
parts of this text or accompanying materials that are not accessible 
via screen reader. 

### Known issues for screen readers

While these are issues we are aware of, we still welcome notes on 
your experience regarding them, and especially ideas regarding how 
we can overcome or ameliorate them.  

- Some math content is not being read by some screen readers, 
  notably JAWS.  We are investigating this issue.

### Alternative formats for screen readers

In addition to the web version, this text may be accessed in PDF and 
Markdown formats. However, the format over which we have the most 
control is HTML, and our initial experience is that PDF produced 
from our source material is less rather than more accessible to 
users of screen readers.   While we are happy to attempt to produce 
the text in other formats, in most cases we think it will be more 
practical to enhance or augment the HTML version.  

## Other accessibility issues (besides vision)

Are there other accessibility issues that we should be aware of, 
besides compatibility with screen readers?  Please 
[let us know](mailto:michal@uoregon.edu?subject=Textbook accessibility 
issues).
