# A Free, Open, and Accessible Computer Science Text

We are committed to making this text and accompanying materials free,
open, and accessible to everyone, including students with 
disabilities. If you encounter accessibility issues with this text 
or the accompanying materials, including projects, please
<a href="mailto:michal@uoregon.edu?subject=Textbook accessibility">
contact us</a>.

## Accessibility features

### Screen-reader compatibility 

We are attempting to make the web version of this text accessible to 
those who use 
screen-reader technology. 
-  The content can be navigated using a keyboard
- links, headings, and tables are formatted to work with screen readers
- images have alternative text
- information is not conveyed by color alone

This is work in progress, and we appreciate your notes regarding 
parts of this text or accompanying materials that are not accessible 
via screen reader. 

### Known issues for screen readers

While these are issues we are aware of, we still welcome notes on 
your experience regarding them, and especially ideas regarding how 
we can overcome or ameliorate them.  

- Some math content is not being read by some screen readers, 
  notably JAWS.  We are investigating this issue.

### Alternative formats for screen readers

In addition to the web version, this text may be accessed in PDF and 
Markdown formats. However, the format over which we have the most 
control is HTML, and our initial experience is that PDF produced 
from our source material is less rather than more accessible to 
users of screen readers.   While we are happy to attempt to produce 
the text in other formats, in most cases we think it will be more 
practical to enhance or augment the HTML version.

## Accessibility of projects

This text is associated with a set of projects,
[shared through github](https://github.com/orgs/UO-CS210/repositories).
Many of these projects have visual elements.  In most cases the core 
learning goals of the project can be met and checked with provided 
test suites, but appreciating the goals of a project may be 
difficult. 

In our experience, a Braille printer is sufficient to produce 
tactile graphics for a few small, carefully chosen examples of most 
of the graphical displays.  We believe that a thermal capillary 
"swell" paper printing, sometimes used for tactile graphics in other 
domains, would be superior, although we have not yet had an 
opportunity to try swell paper printing of graphics associated with 
this text or associated projects. 

We have also found that 
small examples 
are critical to making test cases accessible through a screen reader.
For example, a problem involving a grid of 8 by 8 characters is an 
insurmountable memory burden, but often a scaled down 3 by 3 grid 
can illustrate concepts and algorithmic techniques sufficiently. 

Accessibility of some, but not all projects have been refined for 
better non-visual accessibility with the help of a visually impaired 
student and their educational aide.  We are mindful that they are 
far from perfect, and will appreciate both reports of barriers 
encountered and suggestions for approaches to improving them. 

## Other accessibility issues (besides vision)

Are there other accessibility issues that we should be aware of, 
besides compatibility with screen readers?  Please
