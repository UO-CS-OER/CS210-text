    "#  What for?\n",
    "\n",
    " _Contributed by [Audra McNamee](https://audmcname.com/)_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers convenient and concise ways to write loops, but \n",
    "similarity between different patterns of `for` loops often \n",
    "confuses students.  Using one pattern when another is \n",
    "required often leads to `TypeError` exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brief walkthrough will help you distinguish between \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(len(array)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in array:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## A list of lists \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this walkthrough, \n",
    "assume `array = [[ item1, item2], [item3, item4], [item5, item6 ]]`. \n",
    "We visualize this list of lists as being arranged in rows and columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array =    [[item1, item2],\n",
    "            [item3, item4],\n",
    "            [item5, item6]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We say `array` has three rows and two columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration through the items in a list\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists (and strings) are iterable objects. \n",
    "Thus, it’s perfectly valid to write\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in array:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In first iteration, `row` is `[item1, item2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second iteration, `row` is `[item3, item4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third iteration, `row` is `[item5, item6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we iterate through *elements* of a list, \n",
    "we get the elements themselves, and not their positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration through the indices of a list\n",
    "\n",
    "When you require an item’s position as well \n",
    "as its value, iteration with\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in range(len(array)):\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first iteration, `row` is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second iteration, `row` is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third iteration, `row` is `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## TypeError from mistaken identity\n",
    "\n",
    "Type errors typically result from iterating through \n",
    "loop elements when we need their indices, or using \n",
    "indices as if they were elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you intend to loop through an object by column, and write\n",
    "```\n",
    "for col in array[0]:\n",
    "\tfor row in array:\n",
    "\t\tprint(array[row][col])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The third line, `print(array[row][col])`, \n",
    "will produce an IndexError after the first iteration. \n",
    "`col` is `item1` and `row` is `[item1, item2, item3]`. \n",
    "To access `array[row][col]` we would need `row` and `col` \n",
    "to be indices, but instead `col` is an element of \n",
    "the list. \n",
    " `array[[item1, item2, item3]][item1]`\n",
    " is a type error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we needed indices for `array[row][col]`, in \n",
    "this case we should use `for` loops that iterate through  \n",
    "list indices: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for col in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "\tfor row in range(len(array)):\n",
    "\t\tprint(array[row][col])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first iteration `col` is `0` and `row` is `0`. \n",
    "`array[0][0]` is the element in row `0` and and column `0`, \n",
    "so `item1` will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The take-away: always know whether \n",
    "you’re iterating by item or by index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IndexError from using the wrong loop bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you attempt to iterate through `array` \n",
    "by columns with this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for col in range(len(array)):\n",
    "\tfor row in range(len(array)):\n",
    "\t\tprint(array[row][col])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will print a few elements correctly, then crash. \n",
    "Try to spot the error before reading on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which bound is which\n",
    "\n",
    "The code  above prints `item1`, ..., `item6` \n",
    "then crashes with `IndexError`. \n",
    "This is because `range(len(array))` \n",
    "iterates from 0 to 2, but there is no column 2. \n",
    "When the loop attempts \n",
    "`print(array[0][2])` Python raises`IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write loops to iterate through the indices \n",
    "of list, we need to make sure the bounds of the \n",
    "loop match the list we are iterating through. \n",
    "In the case above, `col` ranges through \n",
    "`range(len(array))`, the indexes of the rows, \n",
    "when we need the indexes of the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correct code to print each element  could be \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for col in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "\tfor row in range(len(array)):\n",
    "\t\tprint(array[row][col])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `len(array[0])` is the number of columns, \n",
    "and `len(array)` is the number of rows, so \n",
    "`array[row][col]`  will always be a valid combination \n",
    "of row index and column index (provided each row \n",
    "is the same length). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Handle empty lists\n",
    "\n",
    "If the length of `array` could equal 0, you must be \n",
    "careful not to access the first column (column 0) if \n",
    "there is no such column.  The code above starting with \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for col in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "```\n",
    "will crash if `array` is `[ ]`. For this case \n",
    "we need a _guard_: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if len(array) == 0: \n",
    "   # Do the appropriate thing for the empty array\n",
    "else: \n",
    "   for col in range(len(array[0])):    \n",
    "       ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the appropriate action will be to return\n",
    "a default value, and we can simplify this to \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if len(array) == 0: \n",
    "   return appropriate_value \n",
    "for col in range(len(array[0])):  \n",
    "   ...   \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mnemonic loop variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "A mnemonic is a memory aid.  One of the most \n",
    "valuable mnemonic aids available to programmers is \n",
    "variable names.  Naming variables well can help us \n",
    "keep track of how we are controlling loops and \n",
    "prevent inconsistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we loop through the *elements* of a list, we can use \n",
    "variable names that indicate that as clearly as possible. \n",
    "If the rows of our array were teams, and the columns were \n",
    "members of each team, then our loops might have \n",
    "been written \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for team in array:\n",
    "    for member in team: \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we loop through the *indexes* of the elements, it can \n",
    "help to use variable names that remind us of that: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for team_i in range(len(array)):\n",
    "    for member_i in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes introducing variables for both the index \n",
    "and the element is useful in keeping the distinction clear: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iteration by row\n",
    "for row_i in range(len(array)):\n",
    "    row = array[row_i]\n",
    "    for col_i in range(len(row)):\n",
    "        col = row[col_i]\n",
    "        ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iteration by column\n",
    "if len(array) == 0: \n",
    "   # Return the appropriate value\n",
    "for col_i in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "    for row_i in range(len(array)):\n",
    "        row = array[row_i]\n",
    "        item = row[col_i]\n",
    "        ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is slightly more verbose than code without \n",
    "the extra variables, but the extra lines are worthwhile \n",
    "if they make the code clearer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a handy shorthand for looping through indexes and \n",
    "elements together, with the built-in function [`enumerate`](\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the snippet above, we can replace \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for row_i in range(len(array)):\n",
    "        row = array[row_i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for row_i, row in enumerate(array):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poisonous variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least we should avoid using misleading\n",
    "variable names.  Never ever ever do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in range(len(array[0])):\n",
    "   for col in range(len(array)):\n",
    "       print(array[col][row])\n",
    "       # BURN THIS CODE. BURY IT. WEAR GLOVES. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives you convenient choices in patterns \n",
    "for `for` loops, but you need \n",
    "to choose carefully and consistently. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `for element in array:` to loop through list elements, \n",
    "  or `for element_i in range(len(array))` to loop through \n",
    "  indices.  You can optionally use the `enumerate` function to \n",
    "  iterate through both.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Use the right list to determine the range of indices. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* If the *outer* loop iterates through indices of an \n",
    "  *inner* list, you will probably need to write a \n",
    "  special case handler for an empty *outer* list. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Use variable names that help you remember which\n",
    "  list is which, and whether you are iterating through \n",
    "  list elements or list indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "* When we write `a[x][y]`, `x` is always the index of the \n",
    "outer list and `y` is always the index of the inner list, \n",
    "no matter what they are called."
