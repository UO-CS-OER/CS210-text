# Project

![A map of a bicycle ride](img/SmithLoop-550x350.png)

Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (also known as Douglas-Peucker and as Duda-Hart
split-and-merge) is an important geometry algorithm for reducing the
number of points in a path to produce a good approximation. For example,
the route shown in the illustration above started as 14,392 readings
from a GPS device. The program developed in this project reduced it to
the 353 points that are plotted on the basemap.
Ramer-Douglas-Peucker is widely used in cartography and robotics, and
has other applications.

This project provides more practice in recursion, list indexing, and 
loop design.
