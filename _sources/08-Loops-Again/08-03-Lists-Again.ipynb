    "# More on Lists, Indexes, and Slices\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to understand in detail how Python implements lists.\n",
    "That's a main purpose of a higher level language:  You can use handy \n",
    "data structures provided by the language without thinking (much) \n",
    "about how they work internally.  On the other hand, understanding a \n",
    "little bit about how lists are implemented can help you make sense \n",
    "of the costs of list operations.  In this section we'll cover _just \n",
    "enough_ of the implementation of Python lists to distinguish between \n",
    "operations that take constant time and operations that are actually \n",
    "loops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python lists are flexible arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `list` data structure in Python is like the _array_ data \n",
    "structure in some other languages including Java and C, or the \n",
    "`vector` class in C++.  It is implemented as a sequence of \n",
    "cells in a contiguous area of memory.  Why should you care that a \n",
    "`list` occupies a contiguous area of computer memory?  That is the \n",
    "key to accessing `ar[i]` in a constant number of operations, rather \n",
    "than looping through 0..i cells to find `ar[i]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Python finds ar[i] by adding the width of i cells to the \n",
    "location of ar](img/list-index.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find `ar[i]`, Python can add the width of `i` cells to the \n",
    "location of the beginning of `ar`.  Finding `ar[999]` takes no \n",
    "longer than finding `ar[2]`.   If `ar` is a list of lists, finding \n",
    "`ar[i][k]` just requires the same indexing operation twice: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Python finds ar[i][k] by indexing twice](img/list-index-twice.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters to us when writing loops is that we can treat a \n",
    "reference to `ar[i]` or `ar[i][k]` as a single step, \n",
    "i.e., a _constant time_ operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several other operations on a list `ar` are _constant time_: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `len(ar)` obtains the current length of `ar`, which is kept as \n",
    "  part of `ar` so that it can be checked and updated without \n",
    "  counting elements.\n",
    "- `ar.pop()` obtains the last element of `ar` and removes it.  \n",
    "  \"Removing\" it actually means updating the stored length of the \n",
    "  array and marking the removed cell as empty. \n",
    "- `ar.append(x)` adds an element to the end of `ar`.  It is not \n",
    "  obvious how this can be done in constant time!  The trick is that \n",
    "  `ar` actually includes some empty cells at the end, not included \n",
    "  in `len(ar)`, so _usually_ `ar.append(x)` can use a cell that is \n",
    "  already in the memory of `ar`.  Occasionally Python must make a copy \n",
    "  of `ar` into a larger area of memory, requiring time to copy \n",
    "  each element, but it manages these areas \n",
    "  in a way that makes `append` take constant time _on average_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already noted that `x in ar` is _not_ a constant time \n",
    "operation.  Python implements `in` by performing a linear search of \n",
    "`ar`, checking each element just as you would if you wrote the \n",
    "linear search loop in Python.   We can ignore it only if we can be \n",
    "very sure that `ar` will always be small.  Usually we can write code \n",
    "that is clean, readable, maintainable, and _also_ efficient.  We \n",
    "should prioritize clean code over efficiency in _most_ cases where \n",
    "we cannot have both.  Very occasionally, in as little code as \n",
    "possible, we are forced to choose efficiency. \n",

    "  elements in the slice.  Its cost is proportional to the length of \n",
    "  the slice.\n",
    "- `ar[i:k] = x[m:n]`.  In addition to copying elements `m` through \n",
    "  `n-1` of `x`, Python may need to copy all the elements that appear \n",
    "  in cells 'k' through 'len(ar) - 1'.  For example, if `ar` is\n",
    "  `['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']` and we assign\n",
    "  `ar[1:3] = ['yi', 'er', 'san']`.  After the assignment, `ar` is\n",
    "  `['alpha', 'yi', 'er', 'san', 'delta']`.  Notice that in addition \n",
    "  to inserting the values `['yi', 'er', 'san']`, Python had to copy \n",
    "  `delta` to a new position after the inserted elements. \n",
    "- `min(ar)`, `max(ar)`, `sum(ar)`, `ar.count(x)`, `ar.index(x)`:  \n",

    "  length of `ar`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of sorting a list is _log linear_ in the length of the list,\n",
    "a little more than linear.  Sorting can often be used to simplify an \n",
