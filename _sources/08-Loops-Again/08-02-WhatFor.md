#  What for?

 _Contributed by [Audra McNamee](https://audmcname.com/)_ 

Python offers convenient and concise ways to write loops, but 
similarity between different patterns of `for` loops often 
confuses students.  Using one pattern when another is 
required often leads to `TypeError` exceptions. 

This brief walkthrough will help you distinguish between 

```python
for i in range(len(array)):
```

and 

```python
for i in array:
```

## A list of lists 

Throughout this walkthrough, 
assume `array = [[ item1, item2], [item3, item4], [item5, item6 ]]`. 
We visualize this list of lists as being arranged in rows and columns:

```python
array =    [[item1, item2],
            [item3, item4],
            [item5, item6]]
```

We say `array` has three rows and two columns.  

## Iteration through the items in a list

In Python, lists (and strings) are iterable objects. 
Thus, it’s perfectly valid to write
 
```python
for row in array:
```

In first iteration, `row` is `[item1, item2]`.

In the second iteration, `row` is `[item3, item4]`.

In the third iteration, `row` is `[item5, item6]`.

Note that when we iterate through *elements* of a list, 
we get the elements themselves, and not their positions. 

## Iteration through the indices of a list

When you require an item’s position as well 
as its value, iteration with

```python
for row in range(len(array)):
```
 
is appropriate.

In the first iteration, `row` is `0`.

In the second iteration, `row` is `1`.

In the third iteration, `row` is `2`.


## TypeError from mistaken identity

Type errors typically result from iterating through 
loop elements when we need their indices, or using 
indices as if they were elements. 

Say you intend to loop through an object by column, and write
```
for col in array[0]:
	for row in array:
		print(array[row][col])
```

The third line, `print(array[row][col])`, 
will produce an IndexError after the first iteration. 
`col` is `item1` and `row` is `[item1, item2, item3]`. 
To access `array[row][col]` we would need `row` and `col` 
to be indices, but instead `col` is an element of 
the list. 
 `array[[item1, item2, item3]][item1]`
 is a type error. 

Since we needed indices for `array[row][col]`, in 
this case we should use `for` loops that iterate through  
list indices: 

```python
for col in range(len(array[0])):
	for row in range(len(array)):
		print(array[row][col])
```

In the first iteration `col` is `0` and `row` is `0`. 
`array[0][0]` is the element in row `0` and and column `0`, 
so `item1` will be printed.

The take-away: always know whether 
you’re iterating by item or by index.

## IndexError from using the wrong loop bound

Say you attempt to iterate through `array` 
by columns with this code:

```python
for col in range(len(array)):
	for row in range(len(array)):
		print(array[row][col])
```

This code will print a few elements correctly, then crash. 
Try to spot the error before reading on. 

### Which bound is which

The code  above prints `item1`, ..., `item6` 
then crashes with `IndexError`. 
This is because `range(len(array))` 
iterates from 0 to 2, but there is no column 2. 
When the loop attempts 
`print(array[0][2])` Python raises`IndexError`.

When we write loops to iterate through the indices 
of list, we need to make sure the bounds of the 
loop match the list we are iterating through. 
In the case above, `col` ranges through 
`range(len(array))`, the indexes of the rows, 
when we need the indexes of the columns. 

Correct code to print each element  could be 

```python
for col in range(len(array[0])):
	for row in range(len(array)):
		print(array[row][col])
```

Now `len(array[0])` is the number of columns, 
and `len(array)` is the number of rows, so 
`array[row][col]`  will always be a valid combination 
of row index and column index (provided each row 
is the same length). 

## Handle empty lists

If the length of `array` could equal 0, you must be 
careful not to access the first column (column 0) if 
there is no such column.  The code above starting with 

```python
for col in range(len(array[0])):
```
will crash if `array` is `[ ]`. For this case 
we need a _guard_: 

```python
if len(array) == 0: 
   # Do the appropriate thing for the empty array
else: 
   for col in range(len(array[0])):    
       ... 
```

Often the appropriate action will be to return
a default value, and we can simplify this to 

```python
if len(array) == 0: 
   return appropriate_value 
for col in range(len(array[0])):  
   ...   
```

## Mnemonic loop variable names

A mnemonic is a memory aid.  One of the most 
valuable mnemonic aids available to programmers is 
variable names.  Naming variables well can help us 
keep track of how we are controlling loops and 
prevent inconsistency.  

If we loop through the *elements* of a list, we can use 
variable names that indicate that as clearly as possible. 
If the rows of our array were teams, and the columns were 
members of each team, then our loops might have 
been written 

```python
for team in array:
    for member in team: 
```

If we loop through the *indexes* of the elements, it can 
help to use variable names that remind us of that: 

```python
for team_i in range(len(array)):
    for member_i in range(len(array[0])):
```

Sometimes introducing variables for both the index 
and the element is useful in keeping the distinction clear: 


```python
# Iteration by row
for row_i in range(len(array)):
    row = array[row_i]
    for col_i in range(len(row)):
        col = row[col_i]
        ... 
```

or 

```python
# Iteration by column
if len(array) == 0: 
   # Return the appropriate value
for col_i in range(len(array[0])):
    for row_i in range(len(array)):
        row = array[row_i]
        item = row[col_i]
        ... 
```

This code is slightly more verbose than code without 
the extra variables, but the extra lines are worthwhile 
if they make the code clearer. 

Python provides a handy shorthand for looping through indexes and 
elements together, with the built-in function [`enumerate`](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate).

In the snippet above, we can replace 

```python
    for row_i in range(len(array)):
        row = array[row_i]
```

with 

```python
    for row_i, row in enumerate(array):
```

## Poisonous variable names

At the very least we should avoid using misleading
variable names.  Never ever ever do this: 

```python
for row in range(len(array[0])):
   for col in range(len(array)):
       print(array[col][row])
       # BURN THIS CODE. BURY IT. WEAR GLOVES. 
```

## Summary

Python gives you convenient choices in patterns 
for `for` loops, but you need 
to choose carefully and consistently. 

* Use `for element in array:` to loop through list elements, 
  or `for element_i in range(len(array))` to loop through 
  indices.  You can optionally use the `enumerate` function to 
  iterate through both.  
  
* Use the right list to determine the range of indices. 
  
* If the *outer* loop iterates through indices of an 
  *inner* list, you will probably need to write a 
  special case handler for an empty *outer* list. 
  
* Use variable names that help you remember which
  list is which, and whether you are iterating through 
  list elements or list indices. 

* When we write `a[x][y]`, `x` is always the index of the 
outer list and `y` is always the index of the inner list, 
no matter what they are called.
