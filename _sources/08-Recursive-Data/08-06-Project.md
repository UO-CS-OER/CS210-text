# Project

The [Treemap project](https://github.com/UO-CS210/Treemap)
recursively decomposes hierarchically structured data
while constructing a hierarchical diagram following the same structure.
Treemaps are as a space-efficient display for hierarchical
(tree-structured) data. 

The treemap project also introduces some new Python goodies,
including disjunctive and recursive type annotations. Like many of 
our projects, it also stresses disciplined incremental development 
of software.
