    "# Treemap visualization of recursive data\n",
    "\n",
    "The [project](https://github.com/UO-CS210/Treemap)\n",
    "accompanying this chapter asks you to create a visual representation \n",
    "of recursive data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially you will recursively divide a _flat_ \n",
    "(that is, not nested) list of integers into groups \n",
    "  represented by rectangular areas.  \n",
    "- Next you will recursively divide a _nested list_ of integers into \n",
    "  groups represented by rectangular areas, preserving the grouping\n",
    "  in each nested list.\n",
    "- Finally, you will process a structure of nested dictionaries to \n",
    "  visualize grouping of elements of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final version, you will be able to process a JSON structure like \n",

    "files (.md), but the scalable vector graphic (.svg) image is \n",
    "relatively compact. Management of file space was among the original \n",
