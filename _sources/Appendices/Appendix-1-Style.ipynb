    "# Style Guide for Python Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most software development organizations have coding guidelines that\n",
    "constitute a _house style_. These may be based on some more widely used\n",
    "standard, but often they will also incorporate norms and preferences\n",
    "developed by a particular organization. Our style guide for CIS 210 \n",
    "at UO is based on\n",
    "[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), extended with\n",
    "some additional rules suited to an introductory course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Living Document\n",
    "\n",
    "This document represents my best effort at defining style guidelines for\n",
    "CIS 210, but like many software documents it requires regular revision.\n",
    "We may find that we need some additional rules, or that some existing\n",
    "rules are annoyingly strict, or that something is not as clear as it\n",
    "should be. Also I make mistakes. Students are encouraged to suggest\n",
    "revisions. Meanwhile, the standard for any particular project is the\n",
    "version of this document as of the project due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics: When in doubt, follow PEP 8\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "is a widely used standard for Python code. It provides guidelines for\n",
    "all variety of matters from indentation to spacing in expressions.  \n",
    "Many matters in PEP8 are beyond the scope of CS 210.  Our key \n",
    "concerns for CS 210 are summarized here.  If something is unclear or \n",
    "not covered here, you may wish to refer to PEP8 (but also let us \n",
    "know if something should be spelled out more clearly here).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable and Function Names\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow PEP8 naming conventions. \n",
    "Use `lower_case` (also known as \"snake case\") \n",
    "for variables and functions.  Use \n",
    "`SHOUTS` (all upper case)\n",
    "for global constants.  Later, in CS 211 you will also encounter \n",
    "`UpperCamelCase` for user-defined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of a programming language form communities with conventions that\n",
    "are specific to that language. \n",
    "You might have \n",
    "used different naming \n",
    "conventions with some other programming language.  For example, if \n",
    "you have programmed in JavaScript, you might have used \n",
    "`lowerCamelCase` for variable names, instead \n",
    "of `snake_case` with underscores. When using Python, choose \n",
    "pythonic conventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Length \n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 recommends a maximum line length of 79 characters.  \n",
    "This matters!  The human eye has limited accuracy as it moves from the\n",
    "end of one line of text to the beginning of the next line. 79 is not a\n",
    "magic number (accuracy depends on many other factors, such as vertical\n",
    "space between lines), but under typical circumstances it is\n",
    "approximately the length at which readers begin to have trouble finding\n",
    "the beginning of the correct next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 refers to\n",
    "[PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstring\n",
    "conventions. We will also follow PEP 257 conventions. We will _not_\n",
    "specify function and method type signatures in docstrings (see below for\n",
    "the alternative), but when appropriate we may use docstring comments to\n",
    "say more about arguments and return values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Function docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring should provide information that is *useful to a developer*.\n",
    "In particular, consider a developer who is building a new module that\n",
    "uses the functions or classes in your module, or who has been asked to\n",
    "add a feature to the code, fix a bug, or modify some functionality.\n",
    "Avoid noisy repetition of information that is already present in type\n",
    "hints, as well as information that is implicit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every user-written function should include a docstring.  The first \n",
    "line of a docstring should very concisely describe what the function \n",
    "does.  Some functions require longer docstrings to clearly and \n",
    "precisely define their behavior; use your judgment, but be sure the \n",
    "docstring describes *what* the function does rather than *how* it \n",
    "does it.  In CS 210 many of our function docstrings will also \n",
    "contain test cases, as described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Type annotations in function headers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python\n",
    "[type annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)\n",
    "(also known as _type hints_) to specify the signature (argument and\n",
    "return types) of functions and methods.\n",
    "Type annotations make it possible to specify the\n",
    "_signature_ of a function very compactly, compared to describing\n",
    "argument types in a docstring. Instead of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def frobnaz(n, s):\n",
    "    \"\"\"frob the naz.\n",
    "    :n:  integer, frob it this many times\n",
    "    :s:  string from which we extract the naz\n",
    "    :returns: string in which the naz has been frobbed\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we will write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def frobnaz(n: int, s: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"returns copy s with its frob nazzed n times\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An absent return type is equivalent to specifying that the function or\n",
    "method returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions that return a value other than `None` (and which therefore \n",
    "have\n",
    "the `-> T`\n",
    "annotation for some type `T`) should typically *not* modify the value of\n",
    "their arguments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I write this function header:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def jazziest(musicians: list[str]) -> str:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "it is implicit that the input list of musicians is not modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "On rare occasions, concise and efficient code may require a function to\n",
    "both return a  \n",
    "value *and* modify an argument. The\n",
    "`pop` method for lists is an example of a mutator method that returns a\n",
    "result. This is permissible but must be clearly and explicitly\n",
    "spelled out in the docstring, and to the extent possible the\n",
    "function name should suggest that it modifies its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the above function returned the jazziest musician an\n",
    "also removed it from the list, the function header and docstring might\n",
    "look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pull_jazziest(musicians: list[str]) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Remove and return jazziest musician from musicians\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite type annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Types like `int` and `str` can be used directly in type annotations.\n",
    "Types like `tuple` and `list` can also be used in type annotations, but\n",
    "typically we will prefer to be more specific, e.g., not just a `tuple`\n",
    "but more precisely\n",
    "*tuple in which the first element is a string and the second element is\n",
    "an int*. We can make this more specific annotation by importing type\n",
    "constructors from the `typing` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def i_eat_tuples(t: tuple[str, int]) -> tuple[int, tuple[int, int]]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert (\"k\", n)  to  (n, (n, n))\"\"\"\n",
    "    the_string, the_int = t\n",
    "    return (the_int, (the_int, the_int))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def to_dict(ls: list[tuple[str, int]]) -> dict[str, int]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert [(k,v), (k,v), ...] to {k:v, k:v, ...}\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = {}\n",
    "    for key, value in ls:\n",
    "      result[key] = value\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test cases in docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to test functions incrementally, as they are written,\n",
    "rather than waiting until a project is complete.  In CS 210 we will \n",
    "*doctests* (tests embedded in function header docstrings) for this \n",
    "purpose.   For example, this function header from the Boggler\n",
    "project contains a single test case for the `normalize` function: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def normalize(s: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Canonical for strings in dictionary or on board\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> normalize(\"filter\")\n",
    "    'FILTER'\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return s.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may infer from the example, a test case is given as\n",
    "code following the `>>>`, with an expected result on the following \n",
    "line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will usually provide a starter test suite with a project, \n",
    "mostly in the form of doctests.   These will help you find and \n",
    "correct errors early in a project, when they are easiest to fix.  \n",
    "However, a function that passes all  The\n",
    "provided test suite is _never_ exhaustive, and passing the provided test\n",
    "cases is _not_ a guarantee that a project is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symbolic Constants vs Magic Values\n",
    "\n",
    "A _magic number_ is a constant other than 0, 1, `True`, `False`, or\n",
    "`\"\"` or `[]` that appears literally in code. For example, this snippet\n",
    "contains a magic number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "area = radius * radius * 3.141592\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more explanation of magic numbers and why they are undesirable, see\n",
    "the \"Unnamed numerical constants\" section of the\n",
    "[Magic Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))\n",
    "article on\n",
    "Wikipedia. I use the concept here to refer not only to numeric\n",
    "constants, but also to strings that carry some special meaning in an\n",
    "application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Put this near the beginning of the file\n",
    "PI = 3.141592\n",
    "...\n",
    "# Then use the symbolic name throughout\n",
    "area = radius * radius * PI\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the same constant is used in more than one code file, and especially\n",
    "if it is a value that could conceivably be changed, it should be\n",
    "factored out into a separate source file. For example, if you are\n",
    "constructing a board game with multiple source files, the size of the\n",
    "game board probably belongs in a separate source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "contains much more than we have included here.  It can be \n",
    "worthwhile reading even if you need to skip over parts that \n",
    "describe Python features with which you are not yet familiar.  The\n",
    "[Google Python Style Guide](\n",
    "https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)\n",
    "is a good example of a \"house style\" for Python within a software \n",
    "development organization.   \n",

    "Kernighan and Plauger's text\n",
    "[Elements of Programming Style](\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style)\n",
    "is deservedly regarded as a classic.  Despite its age and examples \n",
