# README: obsolete files

This directory is for files that are not currently used in the text, 
but which we are not quite ready to delete yet.  This includes three 
sample files produced by the Jupyter Books creation script: 
`markdown.md`, `markdown-notebooks.md`, and `notebooks.ipynb`, each 
of which is instructions and demonstration of a style of Jupyter 
Book content preparation.
