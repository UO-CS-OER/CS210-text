    "# A Notional Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learn to construct useful programs in Python, you will need a\n",
    "clear mental model of how your Python programs work.  At first this\n",
    "may seem trivial, and hardly any improvement over remembering the\n",
    "observable effects of particular sequences of commands.  As you tackle\n",
    "larger problems, a clear and accurate mental model will become more \n",
    "and more helpful.  It will be the difference between a huge and \n",
    "disordered set of particulars, beyond the capacity of human memory, \n",
    "and a much smaller, systematic set of basic understandings into \n",
    "which it is easier to fit one more piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your background in computing, much of this chapter may \n",
    "be review for you.  If you have learned to program in a different \n",
    "programming \n",
    "language, such as C or Java or Javascript, you may note some \n",
    "differences between concepts you are familiar with and our notional \n",
    "Python computer.  But even if you have programmed before in Python, \n",
    "and feel that you have a good grasp of basic concepts such as \n",
    "variables and types, you should read this chapter with some care to \n",
    "ensure that your mental model is consistent with the model that we \n",
    "will rely upon as we dive deeper into computational problem solving \n",
    "through Python programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Languages present notional computers \n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language presents us an abstraction of a physical \n",
    "computer.  By _abstraction_ I mean that it hides (\"abstracts \n",
    "away\") certain details,\n",
    "such as whether you are using a computer with a central processing \n",
    "unit (CPU) based in the Intel x86 series, a computer with a CPU\n",
    "based on the Arm architecture, or perhaps some other processor that\n",
    "hasn't even been invented yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each programming language presents us a _notional_ computer that can \n",
    "be implemented on several different kinds of computer hardware. \n",
    "Because we can program in a language, and not for a particular \n",
    "collection of circuits, it is possible to _learn to program_, and \n",
    "not only _learn to program this particular machine_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notional computers presented by different programming languages, \n",
    "such as Python, Javascript, Java, and C++, differ in some \n",
    "important ways, yet have many things in common.  As your \n",
    "knowledge grows, you will likely use several languages, sometimes \n",
    "even on the same project.  A clear understanding of what those \n",
    "notional computers have in common will help you transfer your \n",
    "understanding of programming in one language to others.  A clear \n",
    "understanding of their differences will help you keep them straight, \n",
    "choose well, and use them together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For now it is best to focus on a single programming language and the \n",
    "notional computer it presents us.  We have chosen Python as a first \n",
    "language because it presents an exceptionally \n",
    "simple and uniform notional computer.  In particular we will use\n",
    "version 3.10 or greater of Python. We will occasionally note ways \n",
    "in which the Python notional computer resembles that of other \n",
    "languages, and ways in which it differs from languages that you may \n",
    "already be familiar with or that you are likely to use in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Notional Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "A notional computer is like a building toy, perhaps wooden\n",
    "blocks, Legos, or Tinker Toys. The kit comes \n",
    "with a handful of basic\n",
    "parts that can be combined to build an unlimited\n",
    "set of more complex structures. A particular kit provides us both\n",
    "some basic parts and some ways of putting them together.  Likewise a \n",
    "programming language provides us some basic elements like objects of \n",
    "particular types, and ways of building up larger structures from them. \n",
    "A _program_ is like a set of directions for constructing and \n",
    "manipulating a structure, the _execution state_ of the running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Python data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the following basic types (as well as some others).\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Python type |  Meaning  | Example |\n",
    "|--------------|-----------|---------|\n",

    "| str | String, which is what we call text. Strings may contain many kinds of characters, including Ελληνικά and 漢子.| \"Hello world\" | \n",
    "| bool | Boolean (truth value) | False |\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value in Python has a type.  For example, `0` has type `int`, \n",
    "but `\"0\"` has type `str`.   The meaning of an operation like \n",
    "addition depends on the types of values.  To see this clearly, \n",
    "consider addition."
