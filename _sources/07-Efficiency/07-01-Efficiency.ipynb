    "# Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some programs run faster than others.  However, the \n",
    "speed the program runs at depends on many things, including \n",
    "the computer it is \n",
    "running on, the other programs that may be running at the same time, \n",
    "and the supporting software (e.g., the particular version of Python and \n",
    "the underlying operating system), as well as the input data provided \n",
    "to the program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We might be able to measure the performance of a \n",
    "particular execution of the program on a particular system and \n",
    "determine that it took 3.5 seconds.   Sometimes we do need that \n",
    "kind of measurement, but we also need a more \n",
    "general way to \n",
    "talk about the efficiency of the _program_ that will tell us something \n",
    "about its relative speed on other data sets and other computers. \n",
    "That is what we call _algorithmic efficiency_. \n",
    "\n",
    "## It's the curve that counts\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of counting seconds required to execute a program on a \n",
    "particular data set on a particular computer,\n",
    "we characterize _algorithmic efficiency_ by a _relation_ between \n",
    "problem size and execution time.  For example, if the time _t_ required \n",
    "to execute a program could be described by an equation \n",
    "$t = mx + b$, where _m_ is a constant, _x_ is a measure of the problem \n",
    "size and _b_ is \n",
    "a constant (e.g., it might be some fixed start-up time that does not \n",
    "depend on the input data), we would say that the program's \n",
    "performance is _linear in x_, because $t = mx + b$ is the equation \n",
    "of a straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "We generally care most about how fast or slow a program is when \n",
    "given a very large problem to work on.  For very large programs, \n",
    "constant factors like _m_ and _b_ matter less than the exponent of \n",
    "the leading term.  For example, if we have one program whose \n",
    "performance is described by $t_1 = mx + b$, and another program whose \n",
    "performance is described by $t_2 = nx^2 + c$, we typically prefer \n",
    "the former even if $m \\gg n$ and $b \\gg c$.  $t_1$ may be larger when \n",
    "$x$ is small, but for very large values of $x$, $t_2$ will certainly \n",
    "be larger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} img/linear-quadratic.jpg\n",
    "A program that requires $0.5x^2 + 2$ operations for a \n",
    "problem of size $x$ (dotted line) \n",

    "(solid line) \n",
    "when $x$ is small, but the lines cross around $x = 12$\n",
    "and thereafter the quadratic function grows much faster. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We seldom care whether our program takes a hundredth of a second or a \n",
    "tenth of a second on a small problem.  Our focus is on efficiency\n",
    "with large problem sizes, where performance is more likely to be\n",
