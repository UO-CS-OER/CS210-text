# Python Programming Kickstart

[Install Python](01-02-Install.md) before working through this 
section, which will review some basics of Python if you have 
programmed in Python before, or introduce them if you are not 
already familiar with Python.  

We will revisit many of the concepts in this kickstart later, in 
more depth.  For now we want to get _just enough_ Python programming 
to initiate your first projects. 

## Executing Python commands in IDLE

Python commands (_statements_) may be executed immediately in a 
_console_, or stored in a program file (often called a _script_) for 
execution later.  In this course we will use _IDLE_ both to execute
statements directly and to edit and execute program files. (Later we 
will explore additional ways to edit and execute Python programs.)

Once you have 
[installed Python 3 on your computer](./01-02-Install.md), you 
should be able to start _IDLE_ from the command line.  It should look 
something like this: 

![IDLE shell at start-up](img/IDLE.png)

The `>>>` symbol is a _prompt_ indicating that
the Python shell, or console, is ready to
receive a statement and execute it. 

Try this by typing `print("Hello!")` on the
line with the prompt. 

```{code-cell} python3
print("Hello")
```

What happens if you change "print" to "Print" or "PRINT"?  Does 
this tell you something about the rules of the Python language? 

Whenever you are curious about some rule or characteristic of the 
Python programming language, you should design and carry out 
micro-experiments to build understanding.  As in a full-blown 
scientific experiment, you will get the most from a micro-experiment 
if you have a specific prediction based on a hypothesis about the 
language.  

For example, your hypothesis might be "Python is 
case-insensitive; 'Print' and 'print' should do the same thing."  
Your prediction would then be that `Print("Hello")` causes "Hello" 
to be printed.  Your experiment would _disconfirm_ this prediction, 
telling you that the hypothesis was incorrect:  Python is case 
sensitive.  Performing little experiments as you work is much faster 
than correcting a lot of code that was built on wrong assumptions! 

Of course there are other ways you can learn details of Python 
language rules. You should already have bookmarked the 
[Python library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
in your browser.  (If you haven't, do it now!)  Don't attempt to 
read the whole library documentation from start to end.  Instead, 
refer to it whenever you need to familiarize or re-familiarize
yourself with some part of Python.  You needn't try to memorize 
anything beyond the absolute basics of Python syntax.  Instead, look 
up what you need, as you need it.  Memorization of the parts you use 
most will follow automatically. 

## Variables and Assignments

A _variable_ in Python is a named storage location.  For example, 
`x` could be a variable, and so could `this_long_variable_name`.
When we _assign_ a value to a variable, we are storing a value in it.
If we write an _assignment statement_ like `x = 2 + 3`, we are not 
saying that `x` will always be equal to the value `2 + 3`;  rather 
we are telling Python to _evaluate_ `2 + 3` (producing the value `5`)
and then store that value in the location called `x`.  Some 
programmers pronounce "`=`" as "gets" rather than "equals" to 
emphasize that meaning and avoid confusion.

Sequences of assignment statements and other Python commands are 
executed one-by-one.

```{code-cell} python3
y = 5
x = y + 5
y = 25
x = x + 8
print(x)
```

Note in the little program above, storing the value `25` in `y` has 
no effect on `x`, because we have already stored a value computed 
from the prior value `5` that was in `y` when we executed 
`x = y + 5`.  If `x = y + 5` was an algebra equation, we would have 
created some permanent relationship between the values of `x` and 
`y`.  But it is not an equation.  It just evaluates the then-current 
value of the expression `y + 5` and stores that value in `x`. 

We can even use the current value of a variable to evaluate a new
value to be stored in the same variable, as we have in the assignment
statement `x = x + 8`. 

If you find this even a little bit confusing, it may help to watch 
these assignment statements execute one by one in the 
excellent 
[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=y%20%3D%205%0Ax%20%3D%20y%20%2B%205%0Ay%20%3D%2025%0Ax%20%3D%20x%20%2B%208%0Aprint%28x%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false)
web application.

## Basic types: int and str

In our example, Python executed `x = y + 5` by "evaluating" `y + 5` 
before assigning the result to `x`.  It is always the 
right-hand side of the assignment (like `y + 5`) that is evaluated, 
and only then is the result stored to the variable on the left-hand 
side.  We can't write `y + 5 = x`, because `y + 5` is not a variable.
(Try it to be sure ... it won't break your computer, but 
the Python interpreter will print an error message.)

How does Python know how to "evaluate" the expression?  How does it 
know what "+" means?  The meaning of "+" actually depends on the 
kinds of value we are trying to add.  Consider this: 

```{code-cell} python3
pref = "The meaning of "
suff = "life, the universe, and everything"
phrase = pref + suff
print(phrase)
```

While a value like `5` represents an integer, quoted text like
`"The meaning of"` is a string of characters.  These are different 
_data types_, that may be evaluated in different ways.  In 
Python, integers
are represented by the values of type `int`, and text is represented
by values of type `str`.  Python has additional data types including
`float` (short for "floating point") to represent real numbers and
`bool` (short for "Boolean") to represent truth values, either 
`True` or `False`.  

Consider this little bit of code that looks 
almost like our previous example, but has a very different result: 

```{code-cell} python3
y = "5"
x = y + "5"
y = 25
x = x + "8"
print(x)
```

Can you see the difference?  When we put quotes around `"5"`, we are 
giving a value that is not an integer, but rather a string of 
characters (in this case just one).  While the meaning of "+" for 
`int` values is integer addition, the meaning of "+" for `str` 
values (strings of characters, representing text) is concatenation 
(like gluing the strings together). 

What happens if you try to mix them, like `"x" + 5`?   (Don't worry, 
although nobody loves error messages, it won't harm your computer to 
try.)

## Functions and Methods

In addition to expressions with operations like "+" for addition, 
operations are sometimes given as function calls like `len("something")` 
for the length of a `str` value or `max(5, 7)` to choose the larger
of two `int` values.   Some types also have _methods_, which are 
similar but written a little differently, e.g.,

```{code-cell} python3
s = "                island                 "
print(s)
print(len(s))      # calls function len on string s to find its length
t = s.strip()      # s.strip() calls method strip to remove whitespace
print(t)           
print(len(t))
```

It's annoying that you have to remember when to use the
style of a function call like `len(s)` and when to use the style
of a method call like `s.strip()`.  You'll probably mix them up
sometimes (I still do, after years of Python programming), but
it's an easy bug to fix when Python complains.


## Lists 

Python also provides some types for collections of different values. 
We will explore and use several of them.  

The collections we will use most are _lists_, which are sequences of 
other values.  For example, `[1, 2, "buckle my shoe"]` is a list of
three elements.  The first two elements are `int` (integer) objects and 
the third is a `str` (string) object.  The elements of
a list may also be lists (we call this _nesting_, like matryoshka 
dolls).

```{figure} img/800px-Matryoshka_transparent.png
:height: 150px
:name: Matryoshka

Lists within lists are "nested", like nested dolls.  (Image by user 
Fanghong in Mediawiki commons, used under CC by SA license.) 
```

We can _nest_ lists as deeply as we like. 
`[["corvids", ["crow", "raven"]], ["primates", ["lemur", "human"]]]`
denotes a list with two elements.  The first element of that list is a 
list with two elements, and the first element of _that_ list is a 
string ("corvids").   

```{figure} img/nested-list.png
:height: 300px
:name: nested

List elements can be references to other lists, as well as other
kinds of object, as illustrated by this representation of 
`[["corvids", ["crow", "raven"]], ["primates", ["lemur", "human"]]]`
```

In addition to actual lists, we will use some other kinds of value
that are very similar.  For example, several of our projects will treat
text files almost as if they were lists of strings, except that we 
have to "open" them before accessing each line of text as a string. 

### Decisions: The "if" statement

Python provides an `if` 
construct for choosing between possible actions.  We'll illustrate 
it with a very simple example: 

```{code-cell} python3
x = 17
y = 30
if x > y: 
    x_y_max = x
else: 
    x_y_max = y
print(x_y_max)
```

We can _nest_ `if` statements within other `if` statements: 

```{code-cell} python3
x = 17
y = 30
z = 15
if x > y: 
    if x > z:
      biggest = x
    else:
      biggest = z
else:
    if y > z:
      biggest = y
    else: 
      biggest = z
print(biggest)
```

Sometimes we can write simpler, clearer code by using `elif` instead of 
nesting `if` statements.  Combining comparisons with `and` and `or` 
can also help.  

```{code-cell} python3
x = 17
y = 30
z = 15
if x > y and x > z:
  biggest = x
elif y > x and y > z:
  biggest = y
else:
  biggest = z
print(biggest)
```

```{note}
We have chosen an over-simplified example to illustrate `if` and 
`elif`.  An even better way to find the largest of three values 
would be to use Python's built-in `max` function.
```

Recall that the symbol `=` is used for assignment.  So how can we make
an `if` statement that checks whether two values are equal?  In 
Python we use `==` to check equality.  Some other comparisons
use pairs of characters:  `>=` for "at least" or "greater or equal to"
and `<=` for "at most" or "less than or equal to".  For example: 

```{code-cell} python3
if x == y: 
    print("They are the same")
elif x >= y: 
    print("x must be larger, since they're not equal")
else: 
    print("y must be larger")
```

Using `=` when you meant to use `==` for a comparison is a
common typo.  Fortunately Python usually catches it and produces
an error message: 

```{code-cell} python3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]

if x = y:       # OOPS! 
    print("This will never happen.  Huh uh.")
```

### Repetition (looping): `for` 

Often we need to repeat the same action with different values.  Most 
commonly we will want to perform an action with each element of a 
collection (e.g., a `list`  object).  Python lets us do 
this with a _for loop_, like this: 

```{code-cell} python3
animals = ["elephant", "tapir", "manatee"]
for pet in animals:
    print(pet)
```

Typically, when we _loop through_ a collection of objects, we 
accumulate some information about the collection as a whole. Suppose,
for example, we wanted to determine the number of characters 
(letters) in all the animal names together.  We would _initialize_ a 
total just before the loop, then _accumulate_ values within the loop.

```{code-cell} python3
animals = ["elephant", "tapir", "manatee"]
total_length = 0
for pet in animals:
    total_length = total_length + len(pet)
print(total_length)
```

This is such a common _pattern_ that it has a name, the _accumulator 
pattern_.  

We will see many variations on `for` loops and on the accumulator 
pattern in projects.  There are other kinds of loops in Python (e.g.,
a `while` loop repeats as long as some condition is true), but `for` 
loops are most common. 

## User-defined functions

Above we looked at calling _built-in_ functions like `len` and 
`print`. You are not limited to using the built-in functions 
provided with Python --- you can also write your own.   We will 
spend a lot of time designing, writing, testing, and debugging 
functions in this course, starting with our very first project.

You may define a new function once and call it several times in 
different parts of your code.
In that way a function can make your code shorter.  More fundamentally,
a well-designed and well-written function can make your code
easier to read, understand, and maintain, by organizing complex
logic into [brain-size chunks](
https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/151291/1/Thalmann.et.al.Chunking.final.pdf).  

You create a new function with the keyword `def`, short for "define".
Give it a concise, meaningful name, and then describe the
_arguments_ that the function will use (the input of the function)
and the type of _result_, if any, that it will return.  For example,
if Python did not already have a `max` function for integers, we might
create one like this: 

```{code-block} python3
def my_max(x: int, y: int) -> int: 
    """Returns x or y, whichever is larger"""
    if x >= y: 
        return x
    else: 
        return y
```

Note that we indicate the expected type of each of
the arguments `x` and `y` (both `int` in this case),
as well as the type of
value that `my_max` will return (also `int`).  The first line
or lines in the indented _body_ of the function is a
_docstring comment_ explaining the purpose of the function
(but not how it works).  This "docstring" is conventionally 
enclosed in triple quotes.  Triple-quoted strings can extend over 
multiple lines and can contain parts enclosed in ordinary single or 
double quotes. 

```{code-block} python3
"""A triple-quoted string can extend
over multiple lines and contain ordinary "double-quoted" 
and 'single-quoted' strings.  Their most common use is 
as "docstring" header comments for functions and for
whole source code files.  Start the text of a docstring directly 
after the opening triple-quote, but put the closing triple-quote on
a line of its own.
"""
```

In our first project we will also
see how to add automated tests to a longer docstring comment. 

`x` and `y` in "`def my_max(x: int, y: int)`" are called _formal 
arguments_.
You can think of the variables `x` and `y`
as placeholders for values that we will "pass in"
when we call `my_max`, like this: 

```{code-block} python3
a = 17
b = 32
ab_max = my_max(a, b)
print(ab_max)
```

In this example, `a` and `b` are called the _actual arguments_,
corresponding to the _formal arguments_ `x` and `y`.  The 
When `my_max` is called with `my_max(a, b)`, we _pass_ the
values of `a` and `b`, setting the `x` value in `my_max` to
the value of `a` and setting the `y` value in `my_max` to
the value of `b`.  

There is much more to be said about functions, about passing
actual values and binding them to formal arguments, and
especially about designing functions that help us think
clearly about our programs.  We will build on these
basics in the next few projects and beyond.

## Start building! 

The little bits above are only a small fraction of the Python 
programming language.  We could go on much longer, but it is easier 
to remember information that you have actually used. We
will therefore jump straight into building a 
project.  After establishing that concrete anchor to your knowledge of 
programming in Python, we can return to fill in additional details 
and take a deeper look at variables, types, control structures 
(sequencing, decisions, and loops), and the problem-solving 
processes we use in programming. 

## Keep reading 𝄇

If some of this chapter is a little confusing, read it again.
If it doesn't seem confusing yet, start on the project,
then come back when the project confuses you to re-read
relevant parts, and/or
give it one more read-through when you finish the project.
Really.  These
chapters are short _so that you can read them again and again_,
and especially so that you can move back and forth between
project and text.  Don't expect to remember everything in a
chapter and then recall it as you build the project.  Rather, a first
reading will get you far enough to get started on the project,
then the project will help you get more from a second reading
of each chapter.

## Project 1

Our first project is 
[an anagram solver](https://github.com/UO-CS210/jumbler).
You will find it on github.  

```{figure} img/github-download-zip.png

Download the project as a zip archive from github.  
```

```{note}
Screen-reader users will find the Github web interface less than 
fully accessible.  What appears to sighted readers as a menu labeled 
`<> Code` will appear as a button that instead pops a tabbed window.
Find the `Code` button, and within the popped window find a link or 
button labeled `Download ZIP`.
```

Decompress the project archive into a directory ("folder") and move 
the whole thing to a directory in which you keep all the projects 
for this class.   If you need to move it from a default download 
folder, mov3 the _whole project folder_ rather than individual 
files, and do not put it inside another folder for the individual
project. You want only one folder named `jumbler` 
or `jumbler-main`, and not one `jumbler-main` inside another 
`jumbler-main`.  

Inside the directory for this project, you will 
find a directory called "docs", and inside that you will find
"HOWTO.md" with instructions on completing the assignment.  Those 
instructions are in a form called "markdown".  If you are familiar 
with the markdown format and already have a markdown reader tool 
installed, you can read the instructions that way.  Otherwise you 
may prefer to read on github by clicking 
through on `docs` and then `HOWTO.md` to reach
[the formatted version](
https://github.com/UO-CS210/jumbler/blob/main/docs/HOWTO.md).
