    "As you learn to construct useful programs in Python, you will need a\n",
    "clear mental model of how your Python programs work.  At first this\n",
    "may seem trivial, and hardly any improvement over remembering the\n",
    "observable effects of particular sequences of commands.  As you tackle\n",
    "larger problems, a clear and accurate mental model will become more \n",
    "and more helpful.  It will be the difference between a huge and \n",
    "disordered set of particulars, beyond the capacity of human memory, \n",
    "and a much smaller, systematic set of basic understandings into \n",
    "which it is easier to fit one more piece.\n",

    "## Languages present notional computers \n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language presents us an abstraction of a physical \n",
    "computer.  By _abstraction_ I mean that it hides (\"abstracts \n",

    "Because we can program in a language, and not for a particular \n",
    "collection of circuits, it is possible to _learn to program_, and \n",
    "not only _learn to program this particular machine_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notional computers presented by different programming languages, \n",
    "such as Python, Javascript, Java, and C++, may differ in some \n",
    "important ways, and yet have many things in common.  As your \n",
    "knowledge grows, you will likely use several languages, sometimes \n",
    "even on the same project.  A clear understanding of what those \n",
    "notional computers have in common will help you transfer your \n",
    "understanding of programming in one language to others.  A clear \n",
    "understanding of their differences will help you keep them straight, \n",
    "choose well, and use them together. \n",

    "parts that can be combined to build an unlimited\n",
    "set of more complex structures. A particular kit provides us both\n",
    "some basic parts and some ways of putting them together.  Likewise a \n",
    "programming language provides us some basic elements like objects of \n",
    "particular types, and ways of building up larger structures from them. \n",
    "A _program_ is like a set of directions for constructing and \n",
    "manipulating a structure, the _execution state_ of the running program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python notional computer presents us with a program execution state\n",
    "consisting of a set of _name spaces_.   A name space is an \n",
    "association of _names_ with _value_.  A _value_ is a reference to an \n",
    "_object_.  The type of the object determines what we can do with it \n",
    "(like the shape of a block). \n",
