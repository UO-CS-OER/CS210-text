# Installing Python and IDLE

This is a project-oriented course.  It is important that you have 
Python version 3.10 or later installed on the computer you will most 
often use for your class projects.   For most students that will be 
a laptop computer or desktop computer.

## Install Python 3 on Your Computer

Python 3 runs well on a wide variety of computers.  You will 
need a laptop or desktop computer; tablets and phones will not be a 
good environment for learning to program in Python.  The precise 
steps for installing Python 3, as well as the precise commands for 
starting Python programming tools, necessarily varies depending on 
whether you are using Linux, MacOS, or Windows.   We will cover 
the basics first in a generic manner, then provide some detailed 
notes for the most common platforms. 

### Download and Install

Start by visiting `python.org` with your web browser.

Select `Downloads` and choose the installer or archive for your
computer.  Typically you will want the download labeled as "Latest 
Python 3 Release" for MacOS or Windows.  If you are a Linux user, 
select "Source code".  Then follow directions for your particular 
platform. 

### MacOS Install

The MacOS installer will work like other MacOS application 
installers. You should not have to do anything extra. 

### Windows 10 Install

Press the "Download Python 3.x" (currently 3.10.7) button. 
If the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) offers
you "Latest Python 3 Release" or "Latest Python 2 Release",  Choose 
the Python 3 release.  This will download an installer.  
Run the installer and follow its directions. 

### Linux Install

You _may_ find it easier to install using `apt-get` or a similar 
package installer for the version of Linux that you use.  You can 
find example instructions in 
[The Hitchhikers Guide to Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/).   
Alternatively, you can download a "tarball" archive of the sources from
Python.org.   As a Linux user, you are probably familiar with these 
steps, which are similar to installation of many other tools in Linux. 

## Execute Python statements and programs

### Executing Python commands

Python commands (_statements_) may be executed immediately in a 
_console_, or stored in a program file (often called a _script_) for 
execution later.  In this course we will use _IDLE_ both to execute
statements directly and to edit and execute program files. (Later we 
will explore additional ways to edit and execute Python programs.)

Once you have 
installed Python 3 on your computer, you 
should be able to start _IDLE_ from the command line.  It should look 
something like this: 

![IDLE shell at start-up](img/IDLE.png)

The `>>>` symbol is a _prompt_ indicating that
the Python shell, or console, is ready to
receive a statement and execute it. 

Try this by typing `print("Hello!")` on the
line with the prompt. 

```{code-cell} python3
print("Hello")
```

If you have trouble with these steps, we can probably help you in 
class help hours, or a classmate may be able to help. 

If you have gotten this far successfully, it is time to dive into 
Python programming, or review Python programming if you have done it 
before.
