    "computational thinking.  The principles and techniques\n",
    "you will learn are not limited to a single programming\n",
    "language, let alone a particular computer or operating system.\n",

    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will use Python version 3, and \n",
    "specifically Python version 3.10 or higher. \n",
    "Python is widely used in data science and scientific\n",
    "computing, in cartography, in web development,\n",
    "in machine learning, and in many other domains, but\n",
    "that is not why we have chosen it. We have chosen Python 3 because \n",

    "\n",
    "- Consistent.  There are few \"special cases\" to remember in Python,\n",
    "  which makes it easier to remember how things work and to build on \n",
    "  what you know. \n",
    "- Concise.  Python does not require a lot of boilerplate, which \n",
    "  makes it easier to read example code. \n",
    "- Well-provisioned.  Although there are many extras that you _could_ \n",
    "  add, a standard and straightforward installation of Python is \n",
    "  enough to build many interesting projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to say that Python is a perfect language.  It is \n",
    "certainly not the only programming language you will ever want or \n",
    "need to learn.   But among the programming langauges available to us \n",

    "## Install Python 3 on Your Computer\n",

    "steps for installing Python 3, as well as the precise commands for \n",
    "starting Python programming tools, necessarily varies depending on \n",
    "whether you are using Linux, MacOS, or Windows.   We will cover \n",

    "### Executing Python commands\n",

    "_console_, or stored in a program file (often called a _script_) for \n",
    "execution later.  In this course we will use _IDLE_ both to execute\n",
    "statements directly and to edit and execute program files. (Later we \n",
    "will explore additional ways to edit and execute Python programs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have \n",
