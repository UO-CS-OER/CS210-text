    "# Binding:  Functions and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior chapter and accompanying project we both used functions \n",
    "that come built-in to Python (like `max` and `sorted`) and functions \n",
    "that you can create yourself.  In this chapter we will look further \n",
    "at both, but especially at functions that you write. \n",

    "## Built-in and imported functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of reusable software written by others and ready for us \n",
    "to incorporate in our own programs is called a _library_.  Python \n",
    "has a rich set of libraries.  In this course we will focus on \n",
    "libraries that come pre-packaged with a standard Python 3 \n",
    "installation.   We will omit consideration of additional libraries \n",
    "that you can install, although you might use those in other \n",
    "courses or for side projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Always available\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions are always present and available. \n",
    "They are documented at \n",
    "[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html](\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).\n",
    "The always available functions\n",
    "include some we have already seen, like `len` and `sorted`.\n",
    "They also include some more esoteric functions that you may never \n",
    "use.  You do not need to memorize them all! \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that methods are very much like functions, but instead of a \n",
    "function call like `len(s)`, we make a method call like `s.strip()`.\n",
    "The methods of the built-in types are not listed in the table above,\n",
    "but they are documented with the types of data they operate on.\n",
    "For example, `strip` is described in\n",
    "[documentation for type `str`](\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).\n",
    "Again, it is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) to memorize \n",

    "functions and methods you use most often.\n",

    "### Importing other modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the functions that are always available and the \n",
    "types that are always available with their methods, the Python \n",
    "standard library includes a large number of optional modules.  These \n",
    "are installed on your computer when you install Python 3, but they \n",

    "your intent to use them.  \n",

    "function _body_ that describes how it works.  Here is a simple \n",

    "separated by underscore (\"`_`\").  The following\n",
    "[chapter on pragmatics](02-03-Hygiene.md)\n",
    "discusses the choice of name in more depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function `abs_diff` has two _arguments_, also called _formal \n",
    "parameters_, `x` and `y`.   The _actual arguments_ passed to \n",
    "`abs_diff` must be `int` objects representing integers.  The \n",
    "function header also indicates that `abs_diff` will return a single \n",
    "`int` value.  This information comprises the _signature_ of\n",
    "function `abs_diff`, which is _(int, int) -> int_.  This is enough \n",
    "to tell us that `x = abs_diff(5, 7)` is a legal assignment that\n",
    "assigns an `int` value to `x`, but `abs_diff(\"cats\", \"dogs\")` is\n",
    "an error, as is `abs_diff(3, 2) + \"turtles\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less obviously, `abs_diff(3.2, 5.4)` is a programming error, even \n",
    "though it will return 2.2.  This is because the header of a function \n",
    "is a sort of contract between the author of the function and anyone \n",
    "who calls that function (even if they are the same person).  Passing \n",
    "a floating point number like 3.2 to `abs_diff` breaks that contract.\n",
    "As [the next chapter](02-03-Hygiene.md) discusses in more depth,\n",
