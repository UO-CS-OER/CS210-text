    "name like `theta`, because it is important for the name to be \n",
    "mnemonic and suggestive of its purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "How long is long enough?  How descriptive must a name be?\n",
    "Kernighan and Plauger provide nuanced and pragmatic guidance to \n",
    "naming in their classic book \n",
    "[_The Elements of Program Style_](\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style).\n",
    "Although the original version of that book uses examples from older \n",
    "programming languages that you may never encounter, the essential \n",
    "principles remain valid.  One of these is that distinctiveness \n",
    "(avoiding names that can be confused with each other) is paramount.\n",
    "For example, `hours_weekday_worked` and `hours_weekend_worked` are a \n",
    "bad pair, because they are distinguished only by middle words \n",
    "that look similar.  `weekend_hours` and \n",
    "`weekday_hours`, or even `wkend_hours` and `wkday_hours`, are \n",
    "easier to distinguish because their differences are more \n",
    "prominent. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second principle, which \n",
    "like distinctiveness is rooted in properties of human memory, is \n",
    "that a name which is defined in one place and then referenced far \n",
    "away needs to be more descriptive than a name \n",

    "likely to be visible on the same screen of text).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Function `abs_diff` has two _arguments_, also called _formal \n",
    "parameters_, `x` and `y`, and returns a single \n",
    "`int` value.  This information comprises the _signature_ of\n",
    "function `abs_diff`, which is _(int, int) -> int_.  This is enough \n",
    "to tell us that `x = abs_diff(5, 7)` is a legal assignment that\n",
    "assigns an `int` value to `x`, but `abs_diff(\"cats\", \"dogs\")` is\n",
    "an error, as is `abs_diff(3, 2) + \"turtles\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less obviously, `abs_diff(3.2, 5.4)` is a programming error, even \n",
    "though it will return 2.2.  This is because the header of a function\n",
    "together with its docstring\n",
    "is a contract between the author of the function and anyone \n",
    "who calls that function (even if they are the same person).  Passing \n",
    "a floating point number like 3.2 to `abs_diff` breaks that contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about this \"contract\", if the code works?\n",
    "Because the contract determines what the author of \n",
    "the function is permitted to change without notice.  Calling a \n",
    "function in a way that violates the contract might work today, but \n",
    "fail sometime later when the author of the function makes a \n",
    "perfectly acceptable change to the body of the function.  The user \n",
    "of a function must only rely on the contract as given in the \n",
    "function header and docstring.  This applies even if the author and \n",
    "the user are the same programmer!  It is all too easy to make a \n",
    "small and seemingly harmless change to one part of a program and \n",
    "accidentally break a completely different part because of some \n",
    "forgotten dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat the body of the function as \n",
    "if it were invisible to the programmer who writes calls to that \n",
    "function, and subject to change without notice, even if it is the same \n",
    "programmer.  This is called _information hiding_. \n",
    "Students and beginning programmers often find _information hiding_ \n",
    "unintuitive and bothersome.  Understandably so, because as a \n",
    "beginner they write most code individually, and seldom work on the \n",
    "same project for more than a few weeks.  This is apt to change as \n",
    "you tackle larger and more complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software systems \n",
    "that matter to people are typically collaborative or change hands \n",
    "over time, and they last much longer than you might imagine.  Even \n",
    "the original developer of a function will find themselves \n",
    "essentially an outsider when they return to it after a few months \n",
    "working on other parts of an application. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another reason for clear, simple contracts and information \n",
    "hiding.  Programs are written by humans.  Human brains are amazing, \n",
    "but one thing they do not do well is maintain a large number of \n",
    "details in working memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We solve complex problems by decomposing \n",
    "them into smaller problems, then composing simple solutions of \n",
    "sub-problems to solve the overall problem.  This is _only_ possible \n",
    "if we can ignore and abstract away details of some of the \n",
    "sub-problems while working on other parts.   If we need to \n",
    "understand _how_ a function works to understand _what_ it does,\n",
    "we can't suppress that detail in any part of the program that uses \n",
    "the function.  Information hiding is an essential tool for \n",
    "controlling complexity by giving us permission to ignore most \n",
    "details most of the time, focusing in on just a few at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Docstrings \n",
    "\n",
    "As useful as the _signature_ of a function is in telling us what \n",
    "kind of values we can pass to it and what kind of value we can \n",
    "expect back from it, the signature alone cannot tell us everything \n",
    "we need to know.  The name can help, but it's not enough:  We can \n",
    "guess that `abs_diff` probably does not give us the sum or the \n",
    "product of its arguments, but the docstring comment immediately \n",
    "following the function header gives us a more complete description.\n",

    "The Python interpreter makes the \n",
    "docstring comment available through its built-in help system:"
