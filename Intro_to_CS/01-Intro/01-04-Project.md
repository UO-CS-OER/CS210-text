# Project

The "getting started" project associated with this chapter is a 
solver of "Jumble" style anagram puzzles.  It emphasizes systematic, 
incremental problem solving.  Think, code a little, test a little, 
over and over as you build up a solution.

The Jumble solver also introduces a couple of common computing idioms: 

- Scanning a collection.  We often solve a problem by checking each 
  item in a collection, one by one.  
- Canonical forms.  We often compare items while ignoring 
  inessential details by putting each item into a unique _canonical_ 
  form.
