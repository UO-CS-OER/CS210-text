# Project

![A cave with three chambers](img/cave-final.png)

[Flooding the Cave](https://github.com/UO-CS210/flood-fill,Links)
is an introduction to recursion (functions that call themselves). It is
a short project, with a minimum of distraction from the one key problem,
a flood-fill function that spreads water in all directions within a
chamber of a cave.
